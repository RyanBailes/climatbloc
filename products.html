            <p>
              ClimatBlocs are specifically designed to meet the needs and
              requirements of every climate on earth. Each block is designed and
              manufactured with two insulation baffles, one on the interior and one
              on the exterior of the frame. Each baffle can be injected with
              2.5&quot; of our foam insulation, providing an R-Value of R-19. If you
              are building in a temperate climate, R-19 may be perfect, however if
              your location demands more insulation, we can fill both baffles for
              R-40 or if you live in the frigid arctic we will fill the entire block
              for an industry leading R-84.

            <p>
              ClimatBlocs have a patent pending passive wall design. This means
              that our wall systems are designed to maintain constant airflow
              through the core of the wall. The perpetual airflow not only increases
              the R-Value and performance of the wall, it also eliminates
              condensation and the mold that often forms in standard wood framed
              walls. The open chamber of the wall also acts as a sound barrier,
              greatly reducing outside noise.

          There is an old saying in the construction industry, “speed, quality
          or cost, you can only pick two”. With ClimatBloc™ you can have all
          three. At ClimatBloc™ we not only manufacture high quality, fully
          insulated, structural construction blocks, we also provide engineered
          foundation and exterior wall systems. It is simple, you send us your
          construction plans or even a simple floor plan and our Team of
          designers will engineer a complete foundation and exterior wall
          system.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Once the design is complete, the plans for your wall systems will go
          into our production facility and construction will begin. Our
          construction Team will use ClimatBloc™ Technology and good old
          craftsmanship to construct your foundation and exterior walls. Your
          complete wall system will then be shipped to your construction site
          ready to be lifted into place and locked together with our patented
          ClimatBloc™ Post-Tension system. Our innovative system assembles so
          quickly your construction schedule will be reduced by weeks if not
          months.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          With a crew of four the average ClimatBloc™ foundation for a 2,000sf
          home is set in place and ready for backfill in 5 - 6 hours. The
          exterior walls assemble just as quickly. Your new home will go from a
          hole in the ground to a completely dried in structure in a matter of
          days not weeks or months.
