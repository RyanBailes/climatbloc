    <p class="mb-10">
      ClimatBlocs are specifically designed to meet the needs and requirements of every climate on earth. Each block is designed and manufactured with two insulation baffles, one on the interior and one on the exterior of the frame. Each baffle can be injected with 2.5&quot; of our foam insulation, providing an R-Value of R-19. If you are building in a temperate climate, R-19 may be prefect however if your location demands more insulation, we can fill both baffles for R-40 or if you live in the frigid artic we will fill the entire block for an industry leading R-84.

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Passive Wall Design</h3>
    <p>
      ClimatBlocs have a patent pending, passive wall design. This means that our wall systems are designed to maintain constant airflow through the core of the wall. Our passive wall design allows for constant air movement through the constructed wall. The perpetual airflow not only increases the R-Value and performance of the wall but it also eliminates condensation and the mold which is often created by the moisture that builds up in standard wood framed walls. As an added benefit, the open chamber of the wall acts as a sound barrier greatly reducing any outside noise.

        There is an old saying in the construction industry, “speed, quality or cost, you can only pick two”. With ClimatBloc you can have all three! At ClimatBloc we not only manufacture high quality, fully insulated, structural construction blocks, we also provide Engineered foundation and exterior wall systems. It’s simple, you send us your construction plans or even a simple floor plan and our Team of designers will engineer a complete foundation and exterior wall system.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Once the design is complete, the plans for your wall systems will go into our production facility and construction will begin. Our construction Team will use ClimatBloc Technology and good old craftsmanship to construct your foundation and exterior walls. Your complete wall system will then be shipped to your construction site ready to be lifted into place and locked together with our patented ClimatBloc Post-Tension system. Our innovative system assembles so quickly your construction schedule will be reduced by weeks if not months.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        With a crew of four the average ClimatBloc foundation for a 2,000sf home is set in place and ready for backfill in 5 - 6 hours. The exterior walls assemble just as quickly! Your new home will go from a hole in the ground to a completely dried in structure in a matter of days not weeks or months.
