            <p class="text-gray-700">
              ClimatBloc started with a simple reality every builder knows:
              projects were taking too long, energy costs kept rising, and
              standard wall assemblies were still fighting moisture and mold.
              The industry needed something better than another variation on
              wood framing and foam.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Our technology is built on years of engineering, patents,
              and real world testing. Early proof of concept homes were
              monitored over multiple years in demanding climates, validating
              structural performance, energy savings, and comfort. ClimatBloc
              takes that foundation and brings it into a modern, scalable
              system manufactured and supported here in the United States.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Today, our focus is straightforward: give builders and developers
              a system that installs fast, performs for generations, and aligns
              with the next era of sustainable construction.

              What Sets ClimatBloc Apart
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              ClimatBloc is not another insulation product, it is a complete
              wall and foundation system. Structure, insulation, vapor
              management, and thermal mass work together as one assembly instead
              of a patchwork of trades and materials.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Our systems are designed for real job sites and real crews.
              Blocks are light enough to handle without special equipment, yet
              strong enough to serve as structural walls. Passive airflow
              through the core helps control moisture and reduce the risk of
              condensation and mold.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Sustainability is built into the materials, not added as an
              afterthought. Hemp lime composites, mineral based systems, and
              next generation energy storage cores all support a future where
              buildings use less energy, store more renewable power, and
              require fewer resources to maintain.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              For builders, that translates into simpler planning, shorter
              timelines, and a finished structure that is easier to sell,
              easier to heat and cool, and easier to live in for decades.
